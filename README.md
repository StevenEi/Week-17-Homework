# 18 NoSQL: Social Network API

## Project Description 
This homework is the foundation for a social network application. I say a foundation because the application is not actually launched as a website, but can be tested via an API client like Insomnia. This project helped me get some experience writing routes and models using Mongoose syntax which is a little different than MySQL. The style of the routing was also changed from previous homeworks as in here, the routes folder only contains the different HTTP methods and the names of the routing functions and not the actual meat and potatoes of those functions. The real heft of the routing code is contained in the controllers folders.

## Installation Information
Install the npm registry using "npm install" in the console. This project utilizes the Mongoose and Express npm packages which will need to be installed prior to launch.

No additional installation information is necessary.

## Usage 
This application utilizes Mongoose models to allow the user to create users, record those users thoughts, and create reactions to those thoughts. It is the groundwork for a social network API.
